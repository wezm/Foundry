  <h2>Apple's Sleek Upgrade</h2>

    <p>Buy­ing soft­ware is not like buy­ing a vase or a comb or a lawn­mow­er where you pay, you take it home, and the trans­ac­tion is com­plete.</p>

    <p>No, buy­ing soft­ware is more like join­ing a club with an­nu­al dues. Every year, there’s a new ver­sion, and if you don’t up­grade, you feel like a be­hind-​the-​curve loser.</p>

    <p>There’s a time bomb tick­ing in that busi­ness model, how­ev­er. To keep you up­grad­ing, the soft­ware com­pa­ny has to pile on more fea­tures each time. Soon­er or later, you wind up with a huge, slosh­ing, in­co­her­ent mess of a pro­gram; a pile of spaghet­ti code that doesn’t run well and makes no­body happy.</p>

    <p>You’re in even worse shape if that bloatware is your op­er­at­ing sys­tem — the soft­ware you run all day. Just ask any­one with Win­dows Vista.</p>

    <p>This year, though, Apple and Mi­crosoft both re­al­ized that the pile-​on-​fea­tures model is un­sus­tainable. Both are re­leas­ing new ver­sions of their op­er­at­ing sys­tems that are un­apolo­get­i­cal­ly bil­led as cleaned-​up, slimmed-​down ver­sions of what came be­fore.</p>

    <p>Mi­crosoft’s, cal­led Win­dows 7, comes out in Oc­tober. Apple’s, cal­led Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leop­ard, ar­rives on Friday, a month ear­li­er than an­nounced. (Apple to Mi­crosoft: “Sur­prise!”)</p>

    <p>Apple’s re­lease strat­e­gy is high­ly un­orthodox: “Leop­ard, a k a Mac OS X 10.5, was al­ready a great OS-​virus-​free, nag-​free and not copy-​pro­tect­ed. So in­stead of adding fea­tures for their own sake, let’s just make what we’ve got smal­l­er, faster and more re­fined.”</p>

    <p>What? No new fea­tures? That’s not how the in­dus­try works! Doesn’t Apple know any­thing?</p>

    <p>And then there’s the price of Snow Leop­ard: $30.</p>

    <p>Have they lost their minds? Op­er­at­ing-​sys­tem up­grades al­ways cost a hun­dred-​some­thing dol­lars! ($30 is the price if you al­ready have Leop­ard. If not, the price is $170 for a Mac Box Set that also in­cludes two suit­es of Apple soft­ware: iLife (iPho­to, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb and the Garage­Band music stu­dio), and iWork (the Num­bers spread­sheet, Pages word pro­ces­sor and Keynote pre­sen­ta­tion soft­ware).</p>

    <p>In any case, Snow Leop­ard truly is an op­ti­mized ver­sion of Leop­ard. It starts up faster (72 sec­onds on a Mac­Book Air, ver­sus 100 sec­onds in Leop­ard). It opens pro­grams faster (Web brows­er, 3 sec­onds; cal­en­dar, 5 sec­onds; iTunes, 7 sec­onds), and the sec­ond time you open the same pro­gram, the time is halved.</p>

    <p>“Op­ti­mized” doesn’t just mean faster; it also means smal­l­er. In­credi­bly, Snow Leop­ard is only half the size of its prede­ces­sor; fol­low­ing the speedy in­stal­la­tion (15 min­utes), you wind up with 7 gi­ga­bytes more free space on your hard drive. That, ladies and gents, is a first.</p>

    <p>Un­for­tu­nate­ly, Snow Leop­ard runs only on Macs with Intel chips — that is, Macs sold since 2006. If you have an older Mac, you’re stuck with Leop­ard for­ev­er.</p>

    <p>(Techie note: Pop­u­lar con­cep­tion has it that the space sav­ings comes from re­mov­ing all the code re­quired by those ear­li­er chips. But that’s not true, ac­cord­ing to Apple. Yes, that code is gone, but new 64-​bit code, described below, eas­i­ly re­places it. No, Apple says that the sav­ings comes from “tight­en­ing up the screws,” com­press­ing chunks of the sys­tem soft­ware and elim­i­nat­ing a huge stash of print­er drivers. Now the sys­tem down­loads print­er drivers as need­ed, on de­mand.)</p>
